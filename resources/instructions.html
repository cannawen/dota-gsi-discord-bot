        <h1>What is Dota Coach?</h1>
        Dota Coach is a discord bot using Valve's Gamestate integration API that
        reminds you of important timings in the game (roshan timer, wisdom rune
        spawning, etc.)
        <br />
        It can also view your inventory and provide suggestions (i.e. buying a
        tp scroll if you don't have one, or holding the philosopher's stone when
        you are dead)
        <br />

        <h1>How to install Dota Coach</h1>
        (You only have to do this once)
        <ol>
            <li>
                <a
                    href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID&permissions=36701184&scope=bot"
                    >Add bot to your server</a
                >
                (or find a server that already has dota-coach added)
            </li>
            <li>Go to any channel and type <b>/config</b></li>
            <li>Download the .cfg file to your computer</li>
            <li>Open your Steam library</li>
            <li>Right click Dota 2, click <b>Properties</b></li>
            <li>Make sure you are on <b>General</b> on the left sidebar</li>
            <li>Add <b>-gamestateintegration</b> to the launch options</li>
            <li>Click on <b>Installed Files</b> on the left sidebar</li>
            <li>Click <b>Browse...</b></li>
            <li>Open <b>game/dota/cfg</b></li>
            <li>
                If it does not already exist, create a new folder called
                <b>gamestate_integration</b>
            </li>
            <li>Move the file downloaded from step 3 into this new folder</li>
            <li>Restart Steam</li>
            <br />
        </ol>
        <b>Optional - enable voice commands</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Give permission for the bot to send everyone's voice from
                discord to Google's Speech Recognition API, so the bot will
                respond to voice commands such as "what is roshan status" or
                "next wisdom rune"
            </li>
            <li>
                This is turned off by default, and needs your explicit opt-in.
                If you would like to enable this, go to any channel, type
                <b>/voice</b> and select the <b>True</b> option
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>How to start Dota Coach</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Join a voice channel (that the bot has permissions for)</li>
            <li>
                Type <b>/coachme</b> in any text channel on the discord server
            </li>
            <li>
                Click the private coaching link provided by the bot (do not
                share this link with anyone)
            </li>
            <li>
                Click the "Start coaching" button on the website (you can
                bookmark this link for easy access)
            </li>
            <br />
            <b>You are now ready to play a game!</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>
                When you are done playing, you can type <b>/stop</b> to have the
                bot leave the voice channel (the bot also auto-disconnects after
                1 hour of inactivity)
            </li>
            <li>
                The next time you start a game, the bot will search for you in
                your last known guild and autoconnect to the voice channel you
                are in (so you do not need to do /coachme)
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the <b>/autoconnect False</b> command to turn this feature
                off, or use start the bot in a different guild using
                <b>/coachme</b> (this will to set a new default guild).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You can configure each assistant to be public (played through
                discord to everyone in the voice channel), private (played
                through website to only you), or disabled
            </li>
            <li>
                Starting the coach mid-game is not fully supported. Roshan
                status may be incorrect, and the bot may start playing old
                audio. If this happens, there is a "stop all audio" button at
                the bottom of the page.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Using the coach without Discord</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you type /coachme without being in a voice channel, you will
                still recieve a private coaching link.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can bookmark this link and start private coaching directly
                from the web page at any time without using Discord
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure to set all enabled assistants to play "private" audio
            </li>
            <li>
                The voice commands feature ("what is roshan status") will not
                work
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Isn't this cheating?</h1>
        This bot uses the official Dota 2 Gamestate Integration API. This is the
        same API that twitch streamers use for their overlays, and all the data
        is provided to us directly by Valve. It does not use any "hidden" data
        that would give you knowledge you should not have access too (i.e. enemy
        cooldowns or vision)
        <br /><br />
        This bot has access to the same information a friend live-coaching your
        game would have. Your friends are allowed to live-coach your pubs with
        Dota+, but this sort of coaching may be against the rules if you are
        playing in tournament games (check with your admins)
        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This bot is still in beta. A new version of the bot is deployed
                daily at 5am Eastern, but occasional hotfixes may be pushed
                throughout the day. If you are playing a game at this time, the
                bot will restart and it may lead to unexpected behaviour
            </li>
            <li>
                If two people use the /coachme command in the same voice
                channel, only the first person will be allowed to play audio
                through discord. The second person's private coaching link will
                still work, but their "public" announcements will be disabled
            </li>
            <li>
                Turbo mode, custom games, or spectating a game will lead to
                undefined behaviour. Would not recommend.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have private discord voice channels you would like to
                use, you should give the bot permissions to access to those
                channels. You could also start in a public channel and drag the
                bot into the private one and it should work 99% of the time but
                there are some very niche edge cases where you will enounter
                wonky behaviour
            </li>
        </ul>
