        <h1>What is Dota Coach?</h1>
        Dota Coach is a discord bot using Valve's Gamestate integration API that
        reminds you of important timings in the game (roshan timer, wisdom rune
        spawning, etc.)
        <br />
        It can also view your inventory and provide suggestions (i.e. buying a
        tp scroll if you don't have one, or holding the philosopher's stone when
        you are dead)

        <h1>How to install Dota Coach</h1>
        (You only have to do this once)
        <ol>
            <li>
                <a
                    href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1089945324757454950&permissions=36701184&scope=bot"
                    >Add bot to your server</a
                >
                (or find a server that already has dota-coach added)
            </li>
            <li>Go to any channel and type /config</li>
            <li>
                Open a text editor and save the config file as
                gamestate_integration_dota2-coach.cfg on your desktop (make sure
                the extension is .cfg and not .txt or .rtf)
            </li>
            <li>Open your Steam library</li>
            <li>Right click Dota 2, click "Properties"</li>
            <li>Make sure you are on "General" on the left sidebar</li>
            <li>Add -gamestateintegration to the launch options</li>
            <li>Click on "Local Files" on the left sidebar</li>
            <li>Click "Browse..."</li>
            <li>Open game/dota/cfg</li>
            <li>
                If it does not already exist, create a new folder called
                gamestate_integration
            </li>
            <li>Drag and drop the file from step 3 into this new folder</li>
            <li>Restart Steam</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>How to start Dota Coach</h1>
        (You must do this every time)
        <ol>
            <li>Join a voice channel (that the bot has permissions for)</li>
            <li>Type /coachme anywhere in the same discord server</li>
            <li>
                You will recieve public tips form the voice channel (i.e. rosh
                respawn time) and click the link provided to recieve private
                tips (i.e. reminder to use your Trusty Shovel)
            </li>
            <li>
                When you are done, you can type /stop to have the bot leave the
                channel (the bot also auto-disconnects after 1 hour of
                inactivity)
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Using the coach without discord</h2>
        If you type /coachme without being in a voice channel, you will still
        recieve a private coaching link. Once you have your link, you can
        bookmark it and start private coaching directly from the web page (make
        sure to set all enabled assistants to play "private" audio if you don't
        plan on using Discord)
        <h1>Isn't this cheating?</h1>
        This bot uses the official Dota 2 Gamestate Integration API. This is the
        same API that twitch streamers use for their overlays, and all the data
        is provided to us directly by Valve. It does not use any "hidden" data
        that would give you knowledge you should not have access too (i.e. enemy
        cooldowns or vision)
        <br /><br />
        This bot acts like a friend sitting behind you with a notepad and 10
        timers running. It may be against the rules if you are playing in a
        professional league (check with your admins), but having a friend
        live-coach your pub games is officially valve-sanctioned.
        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This bot is still in beta. A new version of the bot is deployed
                daily at 5am Eastern, but occasional hotfixes may be pushed
                throughout the day. If you are playing a game at this time, the
                bot will restart and it may lead to unexpected behaviour
            </li>
            <li>
                If two people use the /coachme command in the same voice
                channel, only one person will be allowed to play audio through
                discord.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turbo mode, custom games, or spectating a game will lead to
                undefined behaviour. Would not recommend.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have private discord voice channels you would like to
                use, you should give the bot permissions to access to those
                channels. You could also start in a public channel and drag the
                bot into the private one and it should work 99% of the time but
                there are some very niche edge cases where you will enounter
                wonky behaviour
            </li>
