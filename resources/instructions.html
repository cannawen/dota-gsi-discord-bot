        <h1>What is Dota Coach?</h1>
        Dota Coach is a discord bot using Valve's Gamestate integration API that
        reminds you of important timings in the game (roshan timer, wisdom rune
        spawning, etc.)
        <br />
        It can also view your inventory and provide suggestions (i.e. buying a
        tp scroll if you don't have one, or holding the philosopher's stone when
        you are dead)
        <br />

        <h1>How to install Dota Coach</h1>
        (You only have to do this once)
        <ol>
            <li>
                <a
                    href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID&permissions=36701184&scope=bot"
                    >Add bot to your server</a
                >
                (or find a server that already has dota-coach added)
            </li>
            <li>Go to any channel and type <b>/config</b></li>
            <li>
                Open a text editor and save the config file as
                <b>gamestate_integration_dota2-coach.cfg</b> on your desktop
                (make sure the extension is .cfg and not .txt or .rtf)
            </li>
            <li>Open your Steam library</li>
            <li>Right click Dota 2, click <b>Properties</b></li>
            <li>Make sure you are on <b>General</b> on the left sidebar</li>
            <li>Add <b>-gamestateintegration</b> to the launch options</li>
            <li>Click on <b>Installed Files</b> on the left sidebar</li>
            <li>Click <b>Browse...</b></li>
            <li>Open <b>game/dota/cfg</b></li>
            <li>
                If it does not already exist, create a new folder called
                <b>gamestate_integration</b>
            </li>
            <li>Drag and drop the file from step 3 into this new folder</li>
            <li>Restart Steam</li>
            <br />
        </ol>
        <b>Optional - enable voice commands</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Go to any discord channel the bot is in and type
                <b>/voice</b> and select the <b>True</b> option
            </li>
            <li>
                This permits the bot to send your voice from discord to Google's
                Speech Recognition API, so the bot will respond to voice
                commands such as "what is roshan status"
            </li>
            <li>
                This feature is disabled by default and requires you to opt-in.
                You can disable this feature at any time with the command
                <b>/voice False</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                If your friends on Discord want to use voice commands, they need
                to opt-in by using <b>/voice True</b> as well
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>How to start Dota Coach</h1>
        (You must do this every time)
        <ol>
            <li>Join a voice channel (that the bot has permissions for)</li>
            <li>
                Type <b>/coachme</b> in any text channel on the discord server
            </li>
            <li>
                Click the private coaching link provided by the bot (do not
                share this link with anyone)
            </li>
            <li>Click the "Start coaching" button on the website</li>
            <br />
            <b>You are now ready to play a game!</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            <li>
                When you are done playing, you can type <b>/stop</b> to have the
                bot leave the voice channel (the bot also auto-disconnects after
                1 hour of inactivity)
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You can configure each assistant to be public (played through
                discord to everyone in the voice channel), private (play through
                website to only you), or disabled
            </li>
            <li>
                Starting the coach mid-game is not fully supported. Roshan
                status may be incorrect, and the bot may start playing old
                audio. If this happens, there is a "stop all audio" button at
                the bottom of the page.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Using the coach without Discord</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you type /coachme without being in a voice channel, you will
                still recieve a private coaching link.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can bookmark this link and start private coaching directly
                from the web page at any time without using Discord
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure to set all enabled assistants to play "private" audio
            </li>
            <li>
                The voice commands feature ("what is roshan status") will not
                work
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Isn't this cheating?</h1>
        This bot uses the official Dota 2 Gamestate Integration API. This is the
        same API that twitch streamers use for their overlays, and all the data
        is provided to us directly by Valve. It does not use any "hidden" data
        that would give you knowledge you should not have access too (i.e. enemy
        cooldowns or vision)
        <br /><br />
        This bot acts like a friend sitting behind you with a notepad and 10
        timers running. It may be against the rules if you are playing in a
        professional league (check with your admins), but having a friend
        live-coach your pub games is officially valve-sanctioned.
        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This bot is still in beta. A new version of the bot is deployed
                daily at 5am Eastern, but occasional hotfixes may be pushed
                throughout the day. If you are playing a game at this time, the
                bot will restart and it may lead to unexpected behaviour
            </li>
            <li>
                If two people use the /coachme command in the same voice
                channel, only the first person will be allowed to play audio
                through discord. The second person's private coaching link will
                still work, but their "public" announcements will be disabled
            </li>
            <li>
                Turbo mode, custom games, or spectating a game will lead to
                undefined behaviour. Would not recommend.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have private discord voice channels you would like to
                use, you should give the bot permissions to access to those
                channels. You could also start in a public channel and drag the
                bot into the private one and it should work 99% of the time but
                there are some very niche edge cases where you will enounter
                wonky behaviour
            </li>
        </ul>
