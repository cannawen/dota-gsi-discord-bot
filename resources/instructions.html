        <h1>How to start dota coach</h1>
        (You must do this every time)
        <ol>
            <li>Go to a voice channel chat and type /coachme</li>
            <li>
                Join the voice channel to recieve general tips (i.e. rosh
                respawn time) and click the link provided to recieve private
                tips (i.e. reminder to use your Trusty Shovel)
            </li>
            <li>
                When you are done, you must type /stop to have the bot leave the
                channel
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Note</h1>
        A new version of the bot is deployed daily at 3am Eastern time. If you
        are playing a game at this time, the bot will stop talking to you and
        you must type /coachme again. It may forget some things that happened
        before the restart (like roshan time)
