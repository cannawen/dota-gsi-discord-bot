        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        Dota coach discord bot using Valve's Gamestate integration API that
        reminds you of important timings in the game (roshan timer, wisdom rune
        spawning, etc.)
        <h1>How to set up Dota Coach</h1>
        (You only have to do this once)
        <ol>
            <li>
                <a
                    href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1089945324757454950&permissions=36701184&scope=bot"
                    >Add bot to your server</a
                >
                (you must be an admin)
            </li>
            <li>Go to any channel and type /config</li>
            <li>
                Open a text editor and save the config file as
                gamestate_integration_dota2-coach.cfg on your desktop
            </li>
            <li>Open your Steam library</li>
            <li>Right click Dota 2, click "Properties"</li>
            <li>Make sure you are on "General" on the left sidebar</li>
            <li>Add -gamestateintegration to the launch options</li>
            <li>Click on "Local Files" on the left sidebar</li>
            <li>Click "Browse..."</li>
            <li>Open game/dota/cfg</li>
            <li>
                If it does not already exist, create a new folder called
                gamestate_integration
            </li>
            <li>Drag and drop the file from step 3 into this new folder</li>
            <li>Restart Steam</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>How to start Dota Coach</h1>
        (You must do this every time)
        <ol>
            <li>Go to a voice channel chat and type /coachme</li>
            <li>
                Join the voice channel to recieve general tips (i.e. rosh
                respawn time) and click the link provided to recieve private
                tips (i.e. reminder to use your Trusty Shovel)
            </li>
            <li>
                When you are done, you should type /stop to have the bot leave
                the channel
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <li>
            If you type /coachme on a non-voice channel, you will only recieve a
            private coaching link with no discord voice integration. Once you
            have your link, you can bookmark it and start private coaching
            directly from the web page
        </li>
        <h1>Voice commands</h1>
        The bot will respond to the following voice commands in a game:
        <ul>
            <li>"What is roshan timer/status?"</li>
            <li>
                "Torment has fallen" - must notify bot by voice when you kill a
                tormenter (the bot does not automatically get notified)
            </li>
            <li>
                "What is torment timer/status" or "Torment status" - only
                accurate if the above command has happened
            </li>
            <li>"What should I buy" - suggests a random item</li>
            <li>
                "What should I buy for # gold" - suggests a random item around #
                gold (patch 7.32e)
            </li>
        </ul>
        The speech recognition is terrible at recognizing tormenter so just call
        it a torment
        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This bot is still in beta. A new version of the bot is deployed
                daily at 7am UTC, but occasional hotfixes may be pushed
                throughout the day. If you are playing a game at this time, the
                bot will restart and it may lead to unexpected behaviour
            </li>
            <li>
                If two people use the /coachme command in the same voice
                channel, only one person will be allowed to play audio through
                discord.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turbo mode, custom games, or spectating a game will lead to
                undefined behaviour.
            </li>
        </ul>
