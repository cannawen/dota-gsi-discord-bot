        <h1>How to start Dota Coach</h1>
        (You must do this every time)
        <ol>
            <li>Go to a voice channel chat and type /coachme</li>
            <li>
                Join the voice channel to recieve general tips (i.e. rosh
                respawn time) and click the link provided to recieve private
                tips (i.e. reminder to use your Trusty Shovel)
            </li>
            <li>
                When you are done, you must type /stop to have the bot leave the
                channel
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                If you type /coachme on a non-voice channel, you will only
                recieve a private coaching link with no discord voice
                integration
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This bot is still in beta. A new version of the bot is deployed
                daily at 7am UTC, but occasional hotfixes may be pushed
                throughout the day. If you are playing a game at this time, the
                bot will restart and it may forget some things that happened
                before the restart
            </li>
            <li>
                If two people use the /coachme command in the same voice
                channel, only one person will be allowed to play audio through
                discord.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turbo mode, custom games, or spectating a game will lead to
                undefined behaviour.
            </li>
